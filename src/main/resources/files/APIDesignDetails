1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - The UI represents what the user sees and interacts with on the screen.
   - It can be a web interface, mobile app, desktop application, or any other form of user interface.
   - Users interact with the UI to perform actions or retrieve information.

2. **Components**:
   - Components are the building blocks of the UI, responsible for rendering specific parts of the user interface and handling user interactions.
   - They encapsulate UI logic and behavior.
   - Components may include buttons, forms, input fields, dropdowns, etc.
   - When a user interacts with a component (e.g., clicks a button or submits a form), it triggers an event.

3. **HTTP Requests from the Client**:
   - When a user interacts with the UI component, such as submitting a form or clicking a button, it triggers an event handler.
   - The event handler constructs an HTTP request based on the user's action, including details such as the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL, headers, and request body (if applicable).
   - The constructed HTTP request is then sent to the backend API endpoint via an HTTP client library or framework, such as Axios in JavaScript or HttpClient in Angular.

4. **Backend API Endpoint**:
   - The backend API endpoint receives the incoming HTTP request from the client.
   - It's typically a URL mapped to a specific resource or functionality on the server.
   - The API endpoint is implemented using a controller in the backend application, which handles the incoming request and delegates processing to the appropriate service method.

5. **Service Layer**:
   - Once the HTTP request reaches the backend API endpoint, the controller invokes the corresponding method in the service layer.
   - The service layer contains business logic and orchestrates interactions between different components of the backend application.
   - It performs tasks such as data validation, authorization, and executing business operations.

6. **Backend Logic Execution**:
   - Upon receiving the request, the service layer executes the necessary backend logic based on the request.
   - This may involve querying or manipulating data in the database, performing calculations, applying business rules, etc.
   - The service layer interacts with the data layer (e.g., repositories or DAOs) to retrieve or manipulate data as needed.

7. **Backend Response to the Client**:
   - After processing the request, the service layer generates an appropriate response to send back to the client.
   - The response typically includes an HTTP status code indicating the success or failure of the request and relevant data or error messages in the response body.
   - The response is sent back to the client over the network, completing the request-response cycle.
