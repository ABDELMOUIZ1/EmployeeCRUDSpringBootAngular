1. **Client sends HTTP requests** to the server.

2. **Controller receives requests**:
   - Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests.
   - They contain methods mapped to specific endpoints.
   - Extract relevant information from the request.
   - Invoke corresponding methods in the service layer.

3. **Service layer executes business logic**:
   - Encapsulates core functionality and business rules.
   - Orchestrates interactions with the data layer.
   - Performs tasks like data validation and CRUD operations.
   - Delegates tasks from controllers to appropriate methods.

4. **Data layer interacts with the database**:
   - Manages data persistence.
   - Interacts with the database using repositories, DAOs, or ORM frameworks.
   - Performs database operations like querying, updating, or deleting data.

5. **Response sent back to the client**:
   - Controllers generate HTTP responses based on request processing.
   - Responses include HTTP status codes and relevant data or error messages.
   - Sent back to the client to complete the request-response cycle.
